# Exploring the landscape of Emprical Risk for Non-convex Losses

The code is trying to replicate the results the paper 
[The Landscape of Empricial Risk for Non-convex Losses](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.06534v2.pdf)

It will then try to further explore the landscape by adding regularization (L1 and L2) and by using the cross-entropy
cost function instead.

The code is written in matlab as a summer project.
